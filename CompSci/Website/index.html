		<p class="p1">I am the U.S Youth Ambassador from Antigua & Barbuda, 2022. The U.S. Youth Ambassadors Program is a U.S. State Department-funded leadership exchange that brings together high school students and adult mentors from countries across the Americas to promote mutual understanding, increase leadership skills, and prepare youth to make a difference in their communities. Additionally, I am the current president of the Antigua & Barbuda Esports Club. In this club we teach young individuals about S.T.E.A.M Education as well as Entrepreneurial Life skills that they can use in their everyday lives and in the future. We also conduct gaming tournaments for the youths that are a part of the program. Finally, I am a Penetration Tester in training with the Cyber Security Program hosted by Antigua Recon at Island Academy International. As part of this program, I learn several ways to test websites for vulnerabilities that could lead to hackers gaining sensitive information about the website.   </p>
